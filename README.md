## Projects Page Notes:

Feature detailed case studies
While the primary purpose of your web design portfolio is to showcase your design capabilities, prospective clients will also want to see how your work helped businesses achieve success. That’s where the case study comes in. These descriptive tools allow you to explain the rationale behind your design and the context in which the project was created. By making a business case for your work, you’re in a better position to prove the value (and price) of your work to even the most skeptical prospect.

Aside from visual design assets, a simple case study should also include the following elements:

Project background and description — This provides context for the project including timelines, budgetary constraints, and the purpose for the design project.
Project goals and objectives — Every design project should have tangible goals and objectives associated with the project purpose. Were you trying to optimize product pages for higher conversions? Drive more traffic to the site overall? Reduce cart abandon rates?
Creative strategy — This is where you should explain your thought process behind the design. This could be in the form of design iterations, research processes, or creative insights. Don’t just show designs; explain why certain elements and imagery were used, and dive into detail about your creative process.
Success metrics and results — Sometimes it’s tough to get quantifiable results from a client, but if you can show prospects that your work was able to help past clients achieve results, they’ll be more confident in your abilities to do the same for them.
Your role in the project — If you worked on a team, you should specify what your role was within the project and what contributions you made.
Client testimonials — Client testimonials are another confidence booster for your prospects. These can be simple, two sentence quotes that show your client’s satisfaction with your work. Try asking for them at the tail-end of a web design project.

Note: To create a github react repo -

1. Create a github repo and git clone with ssh key to your local.
2. Navigate to the folder and run 'npx create-react-app .'
3. Run git add -A, git commit -m "Message", and then git push :)

TO deploy to gh pages:

1. Add homepage to package.json ("homepage": "http://raphaelletseng.github.io/mpreact")
2. Add to existing scripts: "predeploy": "npm run build", "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
3. Run `npm install gh-pages --save-dev` in repo root
   (Commit to repo here if you want)
4. Deploy with `npm run deploy`
5. Commit to Repo
   Your site should be published on the new gh-page branch

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
